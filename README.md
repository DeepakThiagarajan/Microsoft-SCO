**🚀 Capstone Project: Microsoft - Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning 🛡️**

**📄 Overview**

In this project, we built a robust XGBoost-based classification model to detect and categorize potential threats in a cybersecurity context. The goal was to leverage machine learning for identifying anomalies based on a variety of features derived from security alerts and logs.

**🎯 Objectives**

📊 Analyze and preprocess the data for model training.
🤖 Build and tune an effective machine learning model.
📈 Evaluate model performance and refine based on test results.
🛠️ Document findings and provide actionable recommendations for real-world integration.

**🗂️ Dataset**

The dataset consisted of multiple logs and security alerts with the following characteristics:

Training Data: Preprocessed with feature engineering and scaling.
Test Data: Aligned with the training data preprocessing pipeline for consistent evaluation.

**Key Features Extracted:**

📌 OSFamily, CountryCode, AlertTitle, Usage, etc.
🔍 Engineered time-based features: hour, day_of_week, and month.

**🔧 Preprocessing Steps**

We ensured both the training and test datasets were aligned using the following techniques:

**Feature Alignment:**

Removed columns present only in the training data but missing in the test data (e.g., ApplicationId, RegistryKey).
Managed extra columns in the test data (e.g., Usage, IncidentGrade) by including them after scaling.

**Scaling and Normalization:**

Applied StandardScaler to standardize feature distributions across both datasets.

**Handling Class Imbalance:**

Implemented weight adjustments to handle the skewed distribution across target labels.

**🤖 Model Development**

We opted for the XGBoost classifier due to its:

High performance with imbalanced data using scale_pos_weight.
Built-in handling of missing values.
Flexibility and interpretability.

**⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning**

Extensive tuning was conducted to optimize:

max_depth: Increased to handle complex patterns.
learning_rate: Balanced between model training speed and convergence.
scale_pos_weight: Adjusted for class imbalance mitigation.

**💹 Performance Metrics**

The final tuned XGBoost model delivered the following performance on the validation data:

**Metric	Score**

Accuracy	0.8483

Macro F1	0.8427

Precision	0.8897

Recall	0.8223

These results indicate strong generalization and balanced performance across classes, especially given the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

**🔍 Error Analysis**

We performed an in-depth error analysis using the confusion matrix, revealing that:

Class 0 (No Threat) was sometimes confused with Class 1 (Low Threat) due to overlapping features.
Misclassifications in Class 2 (Medium Threat) were mostly due to insufficient feature representation.

**🛠️ Recommendations for Improvement:**

Enrich Data: Incorporate more diverse data sources (e.g., network logs, endpoint activity) to provide richer features.
Feature Engineering: Explore more advanced techniques such as interaction features or embeddings for categorical variables.
Adaptive Sampling: Consider active learning strategies for dynamically adjusting the training dataset with harder-to-classify samples.

**💼 Deployment Considerations**

Integration into SOC Workflows
This model can be integrated into Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows to:

Automate alert triage based on threat categorization.
Reduce analyst workload by prioritizing high-risk incidents.
Enhance detection capabilities by continuously updating with new data.

**Future Enhancements**

🔍 Model Monitoring: Implement drift detection to identify when model performance degrades.
📈 Incremental Learning: Update the model periodically with new threat data for continuous improvement.
🚀 Scaling: Leverage cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS Sagemaker, Azure ML) for scalable deployment.

**📚 Conclusion**

Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning, we achieved a highly performant XGBoost classifier capable of effectively detecting and categorizing threats. The model demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment, helping to enhance cybersecurity defense mechanisms in a practical, scalable manner.
